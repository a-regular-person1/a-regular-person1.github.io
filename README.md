    <h1>struggles with the website</h1>
    <p>Hello world! This text is the first lines of code in my final project for computer science. <br>
    However due to not much time and having no experience actually making a website this is going to have to be half baked and probably grade floored. <br>
    One of the main issues i had setting this project up is how the index files messed up the page and would not work. But when it did work it would get rid of the style 
    template which would leave just a blank page with some text so i am doing this project in the readme file provided by github.</p>
